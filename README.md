## Overview
The task was to assist in analyzing data on school fundings and student's standardized test scores.  This analysis will provide the district school board with insight regarding school's budget allocation and priorities, as well as, assist the board in budget setting for the next school year. However, there has been evidence of academic dishonesty in regards to Thomas High School's ninth grade reading and math grades with NaNs. The solution was to refactor the code by replacing the Thomas High School's ninth grade standardized test scores and perform the same analysis over the new dataset. The chief data scientist for the city school districts had requested the following data for the analysis:

	1. Total number of schools, students, and budget
	2. Average math & reading scores
	3. Total percentage of students passing math
	4. Total percentage of students passing reading
	5. Total percentage of students passing both math and reading
	6. Budget per student
	7. A district summary
	8. A data summary for each school

After installation, check the version of the software to confirm it's installed correctly. 
1) Open Anaconda Prompt
2) After the prompt, ```>```, type and run ```conda --version```
	- Make sure it returns ```conda 4.8.3``` or later. 
3) If you need to update your Anaconda to the latest version, type and run ```conda update conda```
4) To open Jupyter Notebook in the Anaconda prompt, type ```jupyter notebook```

## Results
### District Summary
The affect of replacing Thomas High School's ninth grade test scores with NaNs values had minimal influence on the overall district summary with scores decreasing by 0.1%-0.3%
The total student count decreased by 461 students.  This shows that there were 461 Thomas High School ninth graders' scores that were nulled.

### School Summary for Thomas High School
Since only Thomas High was the only school that required adjustments, other schools' summaries were not effected.  Similarly to the district summary, the updated results from the refactored code had minor changes from the original data.  The overall percentage of passing both math and reading went down by approximately 0.3%.

### Math and Reading Scores by Grade
The only changes in the results when sorting scores based on grades were the replacement of the ninth grade's average score value with NaN.  This also applies for the reading category so to avoid clustering the README, only the math results will be shown. The reading scores by grades can be viewed [here](https://github.com/junepwk/school-district-analysis/tree/main/Resources).

## Summary
There were no major changes in the updated school district analysis after Thomas High School ninth grade's scores were replaced with null values. The district summary, as stated earlier in the analysis, experienced minor decrease in the percentages of students passing math, reading and overall passing rate.  Additionally, the average math score for the entire district went down by 0.1%, whereas, the average reading score remained unphased.  The school summary had similar results except that the average reading scores for Thomas High School experienced a slight increase after replacing the scores.
